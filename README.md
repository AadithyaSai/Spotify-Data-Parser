# Spotify-Data-Parser
A python script to parse your spotify extended history and provide interesting statistics

**NOTE:** This only works for the extended history generated via [Spotify's official data download request](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/). The process may take upto 30 days

# Description
This is a simple python script to go through your spotify data and provide interesting statistics such as Most Listened songs/albums/artist. Unlike spotify wrapped, spotify's extended history lets you view your lifetime streaming history
